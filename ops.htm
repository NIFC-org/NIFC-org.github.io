    <h2>Support to Operations</h2>
    <hr style="width:80%; color:#666;">
    <p class="comText">While each of NATO's current operations is commanded by a designated Combined Joint Task Force headquarters, the NIFC is charged to provide intelligence support to each of them. This support has not been limited to NATO alone and when required, NIFC products are shared with NATO's international partners as operational expediency demands.</p>
<p class="comText" style="text-align:justify; font-weight:normal; font-size:14px;font:'MS Serif', 'New York', serif">Some of these missions and partnerships are outlined below.</p>

         <h3>Support to KFOR</h3>
<p class="comText">NATO has been leading a peace support operation in Kosovo since June 1999 in support of wider international efforts to build peace and stability in the area. Today, troops from the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR), continue to help maintain a safe and secure environment and freedom of movement for all citizens, irrespective of their ethnic origin. Following the unilateral declaration of independence on 17 February 2008, the Alliance reaffirmed that KFOR shall remain in Kosovo on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 1244, unless the United Nations Security Council decides otherwise. Over time, as the security situation has improved, NATO has been gradually adjusting KFOR's force posture towards a minimal presence: essentially a smaller force progressively relying more on flexibility and intelligence with fewer static tasks. Again the NIFC provides routine support and frequent visits by a liaison officer to coordinate our efforts.

         <h3>Support to Operation Ocean Shield</h3>
<p class="comText">Operation Ocean Shield, NATO's contribution to international efforts to combat piracy off the Horn of Africa, commenced on 17 August 2009 following NAC approval of the mission. Operation Ocean Shield builds on the experience gained during Operation Allied Protector, NATOs' previous counter-piracy mission, and develops a distinctive NATO role based on the broad strength of the Alliance by adopting a more comprehensive approach to counter-piracy efforts. The NIFC has been a key contributor to this mission since its inception through a partnership with the NATO Maritime Command at Northwood, UK.

         <h3>Support to Operation Active Endeavour</h3>
<p class="comText">Operation Active Endeavour (OAE) is part of NATO's multi-faceted response to the terrorist threat. Its mission is to conduct maritime operations in the Mediterranean Sea to demonstrate NATO's resolve to help deter, defend, disrupt and protect against terrorism. As the Alliance has refined its counter-terrorism role, the operation's mandate has been regularly reviewed and its remit extended. The NIFC provides routine support to these operations.

         <h3>Support to Operation Unified Protector</h3> 
<p class="comText">Between 24 March and 31 October 2011, the NIFC provided direct intelligence support to CJTF UNIFIED PROTECTOR, an unprecedented coalition of NATO Allies and non-NATO contributors tasked to enforce an arms embargo and no-fly zone in support of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973. These resolutions required the protection of civilians under threat of attack from regime forces in Libya. Operation UNIFIED PROTECTOR was officially terminated on 31 October 2011.</p>
